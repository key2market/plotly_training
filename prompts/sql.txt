I am providing you a database schema with table and column descriptions and a question about the data an analyst may ask.
For your response use only the tables that you have available in the schema that I have provided.
Do not use any tables for creating SQL that are not in the schema.

I would like you to create an SQL based on this question and the provided database schema.
In your response paste the SQL between tags SQL__START and SQL__END.
In your response provide only SQL.
This SQL should be for Redshift dialect.
